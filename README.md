# Backend Engineering Challenge


Welcome to my solution to Unababel's Backend Engineer Challenge 🖖

## Challenge Scenario

At Unbabel we deal with a lot of translation data. One of the metrics we use for our clients' SLAs is the delivery time of a translation. 

In the context of this problem, and to keep things simple, our translation flow is going to be modeled as only one event.

### *translation_delivered*

Example:

```json
{
	"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:12:19.903159",
	"translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75aa4",
	"source_language": "en",
	"target_language": "fr",
	"client_name": "airliberty",
	"event_name": "translation_delivered",
	"duration": 20,
	"nr_words": 100
}
```

## Challenge Objective

Your mission is to build a simple command line application that parses a stream of events and produces an aggregated output. In this case, we're interested in calculating, for every minute, a moving average of the translation delivery time for the last X minutes.

If we want to count, for each minute, the moving average delivery time of all translations for the past 10 minutes we would call your application like (feel free to name it anything you like!).

	unbabel_cli --input_file events.json --window_size 10
	
The input file format would be something like:

	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:11:08.509654","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75aa5","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "airliberty","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 30, "duration": 20}
	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:15:19.903159","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75aa4","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "airliberty","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 30, "duration": 31}
	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:23:19.903159","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75bb3","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "taxi-eats","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 100, "duration": 54}

Assume that the lines in the input are ordered by the `timestamp` key, from lower (oldest) to higher values, just like in the example input above.

The output file would be something in the following format.

```
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:11:00", "average_delivery_time": 0}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:12:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:13:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:14:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:15:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:16:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:17:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:18:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:19:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:20:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:21:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:22:00", "average_delivery_time": 31}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:23:00", "average_delivery_time": 31}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:24:00", "average_delivery_time": 42.5}
```
## How to Build

Make sure you have Go (1.16.x or higher), installed in your machine. Then, run the following command:

	go build -o unbabel_cli

## How to Run

The repository comes with an events.json file, populated with the events described in the example above.

	unbabel_cli --input_file=events.json --window_size=10 --output_file=aggregated_events.out.json

 There are 3 flags available:

 - --input_file &rarr; Path to events file. Defaults to "events.json".
 - --window_size &rarr; The window size to calculate the moving average. Defaults to 10.
 - --output_file &rarr; Path to output file. Defaults to "aggregated_events.out.json".

## How to Test

The application is divided into 3 packages: main, events and statistics.

To test the code, you can test each package individually.

To test the main package:

	go test github.com/jmbds/unbabel-backend-engineering-challenge

To test the statistics package:

	go test github.com/jmbds/unbabel-backend-engineering-challenge/internal/statistics

To test the events package:

 	go test github.com/jmbds/unbabel-backend-engineering-challenge/internal/events

Alternatively, you can run tests for the whole application, using the following command:

 	go test ./...
